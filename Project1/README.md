*Brage Brevig*

## Obtainable Results
This project was designed in order to study any number of bosons confined in spherical or elliptical oscillator traps. Based on which simulation module is being run from main.cpp, one may obtain information about optimal parameters and energies for bosons that are interacting or non-interacting, one body density distributions and more. A more detailed description of the mechanics behind the project may be found in a secondary README under the Code folder.

## Compiling and Running

Under the Code folder, a README - file is provided, including instructions for compiling and running the code. As of now, the Cmake file does not communicate with the OpenMP library when compiling with Apple clang and compiling and running this project on WSL or Linux is recommended.
