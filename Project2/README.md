*Karl Henrik Fredly*

*Brage Brevig*

We implemented a general time dependant Hartree-Fock solver, and reproduced, among other results, selected results from [Zanghellini](https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/37/4/004) on two electrons trapped in a harmonic oscillator potential.

## Code and Results
All code and results are in the jupyter notebook "TDHF_Project.ipynb" found in the Code folder. It should be runnable on a linux machines or WSL with the relevant libraries installed.
